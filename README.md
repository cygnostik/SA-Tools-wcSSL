# SA-Tools-wcSSL
 System admins tools, wildcard SSL setup
--------------------------------------------

This script was meant to follow up on the outline here: https://chrismish.com/technical/esxi-host-ssl
...to automate part of a larger process. I figured it would come in handy for other uses too and that maybe others could find use for, or want to improve it.

Feel free to Discord me for anything but support. I just don't have the time: Cygnostik#1337

--- More soon! ---

***NOTES***
This was written on and for use on an Ubuntu 18.04LTS linux server. One which will be kept on the bleeding edge and updates to this script will reflect that.
